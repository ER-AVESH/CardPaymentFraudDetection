# CardPaymentFraudDetection
A Python and MySQL-based fraud detection system for card payments that ingests transaction data, processes it with Pandas and scikit-learn, and identifies anomalies using machine learning techniques. Built with security and scalability in mind.
# CardPaymentFraudDetection

CardPaymentFraudDetection is a comprehensive fraud detection system for card payments. This project uses Python and MySQL to ingest and store transaction data, preprocess the data using Pandas, and apply machine learning models (via scikit-learn) to detect anomalies in real time.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion & Storage:**  
  Stores detailed transaction records (transaction amount, card details, timestamp, merchant ID, etc.) in a MySQL database.

- **Data Processing & Feature Engineering:**  
  Uses Python (Pandas, NumPy) to clean and transform data for analysis.

- **Fraud Detection Model:**  
  Implements supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to score transactions for fraud risk.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  Designed for integration into a payment processing pipeline with alerting mechanisms for high-risk transactions.

- **Security & Compliance:**  
  Follows best practices in data security (e.g., encryption) and is built with PCI-DSS compliant principles.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **MySQL**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **Flask (optional, for API integration)**
- **Git** for version control

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CardPaymentFraudDetection.git
